Currently 
1. The images were scraped from each camera of the DOT Feeds
2. The images were cropped at the location where direction of camera usually sits (Chances of error occur here)
3. Thresholding of the patch so that the text is more pronounced 
4. Manual Training of those images
5. SVM model currently with 82 precision. Definitely not perfect, but with more data can be improved.
